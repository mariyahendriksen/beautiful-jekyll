<p>I am a first-year PhD student at <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl">Information and Language Processing Systems group</a> at the University of Amsterdam. There, I am a part of Artificial Intelligence for Retail (AIR lab) unit. I work on multimodal search and is supervised by Ilya Markov and Maarten de Rijke.</p>

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
