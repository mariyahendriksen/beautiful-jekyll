<p>I am a first-year PhD student at <a href="http://ilps.science.uva.nl">Information and Language Processing Systems group</a> at the University of Amsterdam. I am a part of <a href="http://icai.ai/airlab/">Artificial Intelligence for Retail (AIR lab)</a> unit. I work on multimodal search and is supervised by Ilya Markov and Maarten de Rijke.</p>

I did my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. Earlier, I earned a bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics at Novosibirsk State University (Novosibirsk, Russia).
